## Hate Speech Recognition - DistilBert Fine-Tuning

Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened up a world of possibilities, empowering machines to identify offensive and hateful speech on online platforms and social media. With the increase in the spread of hateful and offensive speech on the internet, distinguishing between genuine and harmful expressions has become an increasingly complex task.

In this project, we delve into the fascinating field of detecting offensive and hate speech, where models like Distilbert, through fine-tuning, have emerged as powerful tools. By training a Distilbert model specifically designed to discern between normal and harmful speech, we can effectively identify and combat offensive messages on online platforms.

The objective of this project is to highlight Distilbert's potential in combating the growing wave of offensive and hate speech on the internet. By harnessing the power of natural language processing and machine learning, we can build systems capable of identifying and neutralizing harmful content, thereby preserving a safer and healthier online environment.
